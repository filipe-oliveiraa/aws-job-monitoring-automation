# Automated Job Monitoring ‚Äì Cross-Account AWS Observability

## The Problem

Before this solution was implemented, support and analytics teams faced multiple challenges in monitoring scheduled AWS data jobs:

* ‚ùå **Manual Verification**: Teams had to manually check dozens of jobs daily across ERP, Fin-Data, and Analytics accounts, which was time-consuming and error-prone.
* ‚ùå **Delayed Detection**: Failures in critical jobs (e.g., Glue, Step Functions, AppFlow, DataSync) were often identified late, impacting data freshness and business decisions.
* ‚ùå **No Central Visibility**: Each AWS account operated in isolation with no unified monitoring framework, making it difficult to correlate failures or view job health trends.
* ‚ùå **Inconsistent Incident Handling**: Without automation, incident creation and follow-up were reactive and lacked standardization.
* ‚ùå **Limited Auditability**: No structured record of job execution history was available for compliance, troubleshooting, or business reporting.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

To address these limitations, we designed and implemented a **serverless, cross-account job monitoring system** using native AWS services:

* **EventBridge** to capture and route job state changes from all accounts
* **Lambda Functions** to process events, trigger ServiceNow tickets, and send alert emails
* **DynamoDB** to temporarily store job states for traceability and reporting
* **SNS / Email Logic** to notify teams of critical failures or SLA breaches

## üìà Key Benefits

* ‚úÖ **Unified cross-account monitoring** for all critical job pipelines
* ‚úÖ **Near real-time detection** of job failures across Glue, Step Functions, AppFlow, and DataSync
* ‚úÖ **Saves 15+ hours/week** in operational time by eliminating manual checks
* ‚úÖ **Improves auditability** and historical traceability of job runs
* ‚úÖ **Automated alerting** and incident generation via ServiceNow and scheduled email reports
* ‚úÖ **Better insights** into job health trends via BI dashboards

üß† Lambda Function Responsibilities

The monitoring system relies on **three purpose-specific AWS Lambda functions**, each handling a core part of the pipeline:

### üîπ Lambda 1 ‚Äì Job State Handler

* **Trigger**: EventBridge (cross-account)
* **Purpose**:

  * Receives job execution state change events (e.g., SUCCEEDED, FAILED) from AWS Glue, Step Functions, AppFlow, and DataSync.
  * Writes job run metadata (e.g., job name, status, timestamps, region, system, etc.) into a centralized **DynamoDB** table with a 7-day TTL.
  * Automatically creates **ServiceNow incidents** for job failures using defined business rules.

### üîπ Lambda 2 ‚Äì Email Reporter

* **Trigger**: Scheduled (3‚Äì4 times per day via EventBridge rule)
* **Purpose**:

  * Scans the most recent job states stored in DynamoDB.
  * Applies business filtering logic (e.g., critical job types or systems).
  * Sends consolidated **email alerts** to operations and analytics teams for any flagged jobs.

### üîπ Lambda 3 ‚Äì Weekly BI Exporter

* **Trigger**: Scheduled weekly (via cron rule)
* **Purpose**:

  * Retrieves **all job executions** from the last 7 days in DynamoDB.
  * Outputs structured data files for consumption by **Power BI** or other operational dashboards.
  * Enables historical job trend analysis and SLA tracking.
